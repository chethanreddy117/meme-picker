Tom's Meme Picker 🎉
Welcome to Tom's Meme Picker, a fun and interactive web app that helps you pick the perfect cat meme based on your current mood! 😺 Whether you're feeling happy, moody, or just confused, there's a cat meme waiting for you.

Features 🛠️
Emotion-Based Meme Selection 🎭: Users can select their emotion, and the app will display a matching meme.
GIF Support 🎞️: For those who prefer some extra animation, simply check the "GIFs only" option to see animated memes!
User-Friendly Interface 🖥️: A simple and clean design that makes the experience seamless and fun.
How It Works 🔍
Choose your emotion: Pick from a list of available emotions that match your mood.
Get your meme: Click the "Get Image" button to see a meme that corresponds to your selected emotion.
GIF or Not?: Check the "GIFs only" box if you're in the mood for an animated meme!
If no emotion is selected, the button will show a pointer indicating an invalid action to enhance the user experience.

Technologies Used 💻
HTML/CSS: For the structure and styling of the app.
JavaScript (ES6): For dynamic functionalities like emotion selection and meme display.
ES Modules: Code organization using ES module syntax to keep everything clean and maintainable.
